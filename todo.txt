- Finish Ram Environment and Screen Environment tests
- More extensive tests for GridEnvironment

Refactoring
  - Make shader interface template / variadic
  - Refactor Engine to make it easier to test
    - Maybe make a physics module with public methods

Game Mechanics
  - small cells can push big cells (they shouldn't)
  - Feeding viruses cause virus splitting
  - names on players
  - respawn bots

Bugs
  - viruses appear inside players => splitting them
  - splitting into arena corner breaks the game
  - ticks_per_step = 1 results in crash
  - num_frames is always 2 even when I pass 1

Performance
- Build out performance benchmarks
- Improve performance of C++ interface
    - Add method for setting the buffer in which to populate state
- better algorithms for collision detection
    - Sort food positions by x position (faster?)


- Convert to modern OpenGL that supports headless rendering easily
- Get rid of dock icon in ScreenEnvironment
- auto clone pybind11 and cxxopts repositories during build
- Make agarle pip installable
- Fix compilation under GCC

- Documentation
- Automated CI
- Client Server
